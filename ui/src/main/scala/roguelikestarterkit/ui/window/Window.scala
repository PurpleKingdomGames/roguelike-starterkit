/* 

Time to revisit Stateless Components.

We have them for ComponentList, which needs to be able to recreate componenets and work purely on the view because the state can / will be lost.

However, we can store the state off to one side in a key'd and managed map.

And if we do that, then button's etc can be stateful, and therefore draggable.

*/

/*

Let's start over.

A Component group is a ...group of components. Anything with a 'Component' instance available.

They are laid out according to some options, but the layout is basically sequential. Horizontal or vertical. Overflow is wrapped or hidden.

So far so good. This all works.

A window, should just be an allocation of space on the screen, in which to hold a Component (usually a group). It has some other jobs like managing events, and depth, but it's primary function is to reserve screen space.

Windows, holders of space on the screen, can be controlled (resized, closed, moved, etc) via events.

Those events should come from the components, not the window itself.

---

In order to replicate a "traditional" window, our components need some new functionality:

1. The ability to be anchored inside the component group, i.e. the close button should be top right (less padding), regardless of the component groups designated 'layout' style.

2. The optional ability to be draggable, and when dragged, to fire an event so that we can 'drag the title bar to drag the window' or 'drag the resize button to resize the window'.

---

Missing stuff:

Optional backgrounds on ComponentGroups? Would allow you to make title bars our of a component group and a label, for example.

Oh and we're still missing scrolling. Not totally sure where that goes yet. Clearly it's going to be important. I _think_ it's _probably_ and component group / list thing.

Might also need model windows that sit above everything.

Padding on anchors.

Labels with borders.

Some way to define the content rectangle of a window?

Terminal components, supplying a string isn't always nice, would be good to allow a Batch[Tile] or something.
